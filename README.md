# DIY Grooming

A team based project with the { W.A.N.T } team – Coder Academy FX1 Melbourne 2021 to create a full-stack web application.

### About the project

The Notting Hill neighbourhood management approached us to help them create an online blog, dedicated to dog owners in the community. 

The online blog will be a platform to share and find step-by-step DIY dog grooming instructions. It can be accessed by the Notting Hill neighbourhood community as well as other people interested in the DIY dog grooming. Anyone including professional groomers can register and share their tips and tricks. Additionally, professional dog groomers can promote their services and possibly be contacted when their service is needed.
