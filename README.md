# DIY Grooming

Coder Academy FX1 Melbourne 2021 final project –– a team collaboration project to create a full-stack web application.

### About the project

The Notting Hill neighbourhood management approached us to help them create an online blog dedicated to dog owners in the community.

The online blog will be a platform to share and find step-by-step DIY dog grooming instructions. The Notting Hill neighbourhood community and anyone interested in DIY dog grooming can access the blog. Additionally, professional groomers can also register and share their tips and tricks. Furthermore, promote their services and be contacted when their service is needed.

Utilising the GitHub organisation, 🏛 [DIY Grooming](https://github.com/DIYGrooming), the project is managed into separate repositories (micro-sites), which serves the whole full-stack project better as team collaboration.
